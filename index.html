                <h2 class="section-title">From last time</h3>
                    <p>Last meeting, we touched on the importance of synchronized swimming as a team bonding activity.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uniqua mentioned she cannot participate since she can't swim</li>
                        <li>Sasuke scoffed at the idea and said, <span>"If I am forced to go, I will unleash chidori on the pool"</span></li>
                        <li>Bradley took out his guitar and started yodeling (no comment on synchronized swimming)</li>
                        <li><strong>Vote was split 5-5, Steven broke the tie in favor of synchronized swimming</strong></li>
                        <li>First lesson next Monday</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2 class="section-title">Today's notes</h3>
                    <p>Today, we discuss the order in which cereal and milk go in the bowl.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pablo thinks that milk should go first</li>
                        <li>Naruto interjected, saying that Pablo <span>"has it twisted dattebayo"</span></li>
                        <li>Pablo started pecking Naruto, resulting in security being called in</li>
                        <li>After 15 minute recess, meeting resumed</li>
                        <li>Tyrone believes that any order is fine, it is up to the person's preference</li>
                        <li>Pikachu said <span>"pika pika pi"</span> in agreement</li>
                        <li>Tasha brings up that if milk goes first, we save more at the pump</li>
                        <li>Tasha's point led to murmurs and nods of agreement in the room</li>
                        <li><b>Vote was 7-1 in favor of milk first</b>, <i>only Naruto</i> disagreed (Tyrone and Pikachu abstained)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After agreeing that milk goes first, we then discussed why every time we touch I get this feeling? And every time we kiss I swear I can fly?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can't you feel my heart beat fast</li>
                        <li>I want this to last</li>
                        <li>Need you by my side</li>
                        <li>Cause every time we touch</li>
                        <li>I feel this static</li>
                        <li>And every time we kiss</li>
                        <li>I reach for the sky</li>
                        <li>Can't you hear my haert beat so</li>
                        <li>I can't let you go</li>
                        <li>Want you in my life</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2 class="section-title">Miscellaneous</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After the meeting, Bradley gathered all of us around a campfire and we sang heartwarming songs together</li>
                        <li>I want clam chowder</li>
